Building
--------

1 - Build the admin and leaderboard applications
  mvn clean install -Padmin
  mvn clean install -Pleaderboard
2 - Build the main application
  mvn clean install
  (add -DskipTests to build without running tests)
  (add -Drequirejs to optimise client application)

Deploying
---------

There are three deployable artifacts created by the build
 - distribution/target/drools-guvnor.war
   Guvnor application
 - distribution/target/designer.war
   Process Designer application
 - distribution/target/jbwdemo-application.ear
   REST services, jBPM integration, mobile client application

During the keynote demo we deployed the Guvnor and Designer applications on one server with the REST services etc. being deployed on a second server, however all artifacts can be deployed on the same server.

Configuring Guvnor Server
-------------------------

1 - Add drools-guvnor domain into standalone/configuration/standalone.xml

        <security-domain name="drools-guvnor" cache-type="default">
            <authentication>
                <login-module code="UsersRoles" flag="required">
                    <module-option name="usersProperties" value="${jboss.server.config.dir}/guvnor-users.properties"/>
                    <module-option name="rolesProperties" value="${jboss.server.config.dir}/guvnor-roles.properties"/>
                </login-module>
            </authentication>
        </security-domain>

2 - Create standalone/configuration/guvnor-users.properties
        admin=admin

3 - Create standalone/configuration/guvnor-roles.properties
        admin=admin,manager,user,webdesigner,functionalanalyst

Configuring REST Server
-----------------------
If you are using the default h2 ExampleDS then make sure that you enable MVCC as follows
    <connection-url>jdbc:h2:mem:test;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1;MVCC=TRUE</connection-url>

You may also have to increase the deployment timeout on the deployment scanner, in order to give the consoles time to deploy.  This can be done by locating the 'deployment-scanner' element and specifying the timeout as follows
    <deployment-scanner path="deployments" relative-to="jboss.server.base.dir" scan-interval="5000" deployment-timeout="180"/>

Initialising Guvnor Repository
------------------------------

After deploying the Guvnor/designer applications, and configuring the Guvnor server, log in to the Guvnor console (<host>:<port>/drools-guvnor, user admin, password admin) and import the repository using the contents of process/guvnor_repository_export.zip

Accessing the Client Application
--------------------------------

- buyer application
  <host>:<port>/jbossworld-client
- approver application (password is letmein)
  <host>:<port>/jbossworld-client/#approver
- VP application (password is letmein)
  <host>:<port>/jbossworld-client/#vp
- To switch between roles, you must first logout. Once logged out, you will not be able to return to the previous role so a new role will be created when you log in again
  <host>:<port>/jbossworld-client/#logout

Running Robots
--------------

Execute the following from within the robots directory
  mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=org.jboss.jbw2012.keynote.robots.RobotsClient

NOTE
----

Some of the functionality in this demo has still to be completed.  The current version represents the code as it stood on the day of the JBossWorld 2012 Keynote Demo.
